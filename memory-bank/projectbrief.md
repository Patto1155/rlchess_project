# RL Chess Project Brief

## Goal
Create a ready-to-run reinforcement learning chess system that:
- Starts with only knowledge of chess rules
- Learns through self-play using RL algorithms
- Provides live spectating during training with nice UI
- Allows human vs bot gameplay after training
- Built in Python with modern libraries

## Core Requirements
1. **Chess Engine**: Legal move validation, game state management
2. **RL Agent**: Neural network that learns from self-play
3. **Training System**: Self-play loop with model updates
4. **Spectator UI**: Real-time visualization of games during training
5. **Play Interface**: Human vs bot gameplay with intuitive controls
6. **Ready-to-Run**: Complete setup with dependencies and clear instructions

## Success Criteria
- Bot learns to play chess from scratch (no opening books/endgame tables)
- UI shows live games during training with move history
- Smooth gameplay experience against trained bot
- Easy installation and execution process
- Clean, maintainable codebase with good documentation

## Technical Approach
- Use PyTorch for neural networks
- Implement AlphaZero-style algorithm (MCTS + Neural Network)
- Tkinter or PyQt for UI (cross-platform)
- Chess library for rules and board representation
- Threading for concurrent training and UI updates

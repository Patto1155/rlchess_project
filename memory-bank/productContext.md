# Product Context - RL Chess

## Problem Solved
This project aims to create an accessible and understandable implementation of a reinforcement learning chess agent. Many existing RL chess projects are either too complex to easily dissect or lack a user-friendly interface for observing the learning process and interacting with the trained agent.

## How It Works (User Perspective)
- The user can start the application and initiate a training process.
- During training, the UI will display live chess games being played by the AI against itself.
- Key statistics about the training progress (e.g., games played, model strength) will be visible.
- Once the user is satisfied with the training, they can stop the process.
- The user can then choose to play a game of chess against the trained AI.
- The system should allow saving and loading of trained models to preserve progress.

## User Experience Goals
- **Ease of Use**: Simple to install and run. Intuitive controls for starting/stopping training and playing games.
- **Transparency**: Clear visualization of the AI's self-play games and training metrics.
- **Engagement**: Fun to watch the AI learn and challenging to play against once trained.
- **Educational**: Provides a practical example of how AlphaZero-like algorithms learn complex games.
